Welcome to hell.

Take anything you want from here, I don't mind. :)

I use:

- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) with just i3status and picom (obviously I had to be cool)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io) with my [Astronvim](https://astronvim.com) user config, powered by fzf, bat and lazygit
- [flameshot](https://flameshot.org) for screenshots
- [alacritty](https://alacritty.org) for terminal emulator, with Fira Code fonts
- zsh with [zim](https://zimfw.sh) so I look even cooler
- lazygit for easier git because good lord I can't stand git
